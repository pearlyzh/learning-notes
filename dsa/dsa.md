## Back Tracking
- A general approach to backtracking questions in Java (Subsets, Permutations, Combination Sum, Palindrome Partitioning): https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/discuss/27281/A-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-Java-(Subsets-Permutations-Combination-Sum-Palindrome-Partitioning)

## Graph theory
- BFS vs DFS: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3332947/when-is-it-practical-to-use-depth-first-search-dfs-vs-breadth-first-search-bf 

## Probabilistic
- Hyperloglog
- Count min sketch
- Bloom filter
## Disruptor
- Ring buffer

- Key concepts:
    - https://itnext.io/understanding-the-lmax-disruptor-caaaa2721496
    - The LMAX Disruptor solution is faster than Java ArrayBlockingQueue and LinkedBlockingQueue.
    - A mechanical sympathy (good understanding of the underlying hardware) should make you a better developer.
    - Sharing memory between threads is prone to problems, you need to do it carefully.
    - CPU caches are faster than main memory but a bad understanding of how they work (cache lines etc.) can ruin your performance.

## Tree:
- Traversal:
    - In-order: Left - Root- Right
    - Pre-order: Root - Left - Right
    - Post-order: Left - Right - Root
