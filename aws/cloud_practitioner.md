## Cloud computing
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### On-premis - Cloud Providers
 - You own the servers - Someone else owns the servers
 - You hire the IT people - Someone else hires the IT people
 - You pay or rent the real-estate - Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
 - You take all the risk - You are responsible for configuring cloud services and the code, someone else takes care of the rest.

 ### The evolution of Cloud hosting
 - Dedicated server -> very expensive, high maintanence, high security
 - Virtual Private server: The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines -> Better utilization and Isolation of Resources
