# Theory
## Backstory
- Prior to TCP/IP, it was the era of circuit switching, which
required dedicated connection between two parties for communication
to happen. TCP/IP came up with its packet switching design, which was
more open and peer-to-peer with no need to preestablish a dedicated line
between parties.
- When the Internet was made accessible to the public through the
World Wide Web (WWW) in the early 1990s, it was supposed to be
more open and peer-to- peer. This is because it was built atop the open
and decentralized TCP/IP.
- Slowly and gradually, people get used to
what technology offers. People are just fine if an international transaction
takes days to settle, or it is too expensive, or it is less reliable.
### Bank transaction
- Technology enabled someone from India to make a monetary
transaction with someone in the United Kingdom, but with some cost.
- It takes days to settle such transactions and is expensive as well. A bank was
always needed to impose trust and ensure security for such transactions
between two or more parties
- What if technology could enable trust and security without these intermediary and centralized systems? Blockchain proves to be that missing piece of the Internet revolution puzzle

## What the hell is it?
- It is a system of records to transact value (**NOT JUST MONEY!**) in a peer-to-peer fashion.
- There is no need for a trusted intermediary such as banks, brokers, or other escrow services to serve as a trusted third party.
- It is a shared, decentralized, and open ledger of transactions. This ledger database is replicated across a large number of nodes.
- Just the way TCP/IP was designed to achieve an open system, blockchain technology was designed to enable true decentralization. In an effort to do so, the creators of Bitcoin open-sourced it so it could inspire many decentralized applications.
- Every node on the blockchain network has an identical copy of the
blockchain. The other part of a block is the "body content" that has a
validated list of transactions, their amounts, the addresses of the parties
involved, and some more details. So, given the latest block, it is feasible to
access all the previous blocks in a blockchain
